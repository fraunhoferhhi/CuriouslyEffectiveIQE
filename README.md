You can reproduce our results with the following steps:

1. Set up a python environment using the provided *CuriousFeatures.yml* file.
2. Download the datasets and use *format_datasets.py* to bring the data into the expected format.
3. Run *bash feature_extraction.sh* in your terminal. This will extract features according to the paper from all images in all databases. We provide two scripts here, *feature_extraction.sh* and *feature_extraction_reproduce.sh*. *feature_extraction.sh* uses PyTorch and runs considerably faster than *feature_extraction_reproduce.sh*, however, results will likely deviate slightly from the results reported in the paper. If you want to reproduce our results and do not care about computational speed, you can use *feature_extraction_reproduce.sh*.
4. Open the jupyter notebook *Experiments.ipynb* and follow the instructions therein to reproduce reported correlations.
